Twenty-one year old resident of Morocco. passionate about web development. I chose this path because I found my passion for it when I realized I had a keen attention to detail. I've found that I focus a lot on design in fact it's the only form of development that a user will actually see. Every optimization or decision you make actually counts, every image optimization, padding increase or animation in CSS makes a huge difference to every user, it really fulfills my need for creativity.I spent all the previous two years learning about this field With the help of my professors at the institute, YouTube and online certifications.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS
